       <p class="about-us"> Our chilli sauces are made in the heart of Mount kenya from freshly harvested peppers. The jalapeños and habanero peppers are roasted on charcoal by hands, blended along with spices, sea salt and other ingredients to create a perfectly balanced hot sauce. Pairs perfectly with tortilla chips, seafood, BBQ and tacos.

          <div><p>A fiery North African mix of roasted chiles, garlic, and spices like coriander and caraway. The roasted chiles give the condiment a smoky edge, rounding out the sweetness of roasted bell peppers or the acidity of tomato sauce. Toss with roasted potatoes or stir into yogurt to top grilled meat.</p></div>
          <div><p>Fresno, red jalapeño, or Thai chiles simmer with rice wine vinegar and fish sauce for a not-too-hot, sweet sauce. The sticky sauce is an instant glaze for roasts or seafood, and a perfect dipping sauce for spring rolls.</p></div>
          <div><p>This Indonesian blend of fresh chiles and vinegar offers bright, tangy heat. Unlike Sriracha, Sambal doesn’t have the balancing sweetness of sugar. You can also see the crushed chiles in the sauce. It’s fantastic in brothy soups or noodle stir-fries.</p></div>
          <div><p>This thick Thai condiment gets flavor balance from garlic, distilled vinegar, sugar, and salt. It has the savory, sweet, and punchy notes that make it as addictive and all-purpose as ketchup, though with pronounced heat. Drizzle into a bowl of pho or on eggs.</p></div>

          <p>“I thought I liked hot sauce until I found out about Afra chillies. That was the real deal! A real eye-opener that the uninspired 'hot sauce' I was eating before, didn't do much more other than setting my taste buds on fire. With Hush Hush, I even use it for my breakfast eggs from time to time (that's a first - who am I?). Favorite flavor: Habanero / Sweet Potato, all day.”  Mohammed</p></div>
